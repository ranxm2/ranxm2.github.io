Iâ€™m a Bioinformatics Analyst in the ENCORE Group at the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University. Iâ€™ve recently been admitted to the Computer Science PhD program at Emoryâ€™s College of Engineering for Fall 2025, where I will continue my work at the intersection of statistics, genomics, and machine learning.

My research interests include:
- **Spatial & single-cell transcriptomics**  
- **Integrative multi-omics analysis**  
- **Machine learning for biomarker discovery**  
- **Pathway and network modeling in neurological disorders**

I am honored to be advised by [Dr. Zhaohui (Steve) Qin](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=zhaohui%20%20steve%20-qin-8697) at Emory University.  
I earned my MSPH in Biostatistics from Emory University in May 2024.
