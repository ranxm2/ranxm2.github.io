Bile acid–gut microbiota imbalance in cholestasis and its long-term effect in mice investigates the prolonged impact of transient bile duct obstruction on the gut microbial ecosystem. Using a reversible bile duct ligation model in mice, the authors performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile microbiota changes in both small and large intestines. They observed significant reductions in alpha diversity, overgrowth of *Escherichia–Shigella* species rich in virulence factors, and an overall compositional shift that persisted weeks after bile flow was restored. To establish causality, fecal microbiota from cholestasis mice were transplanted into germ-free recipients, which subsequently developed hepatic inflammation, liver damage, and bile acid accumulation—mirroring the donor phenotype. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring and therapeutically targeting gut microbiota composition during and after cholestatic injury to mitigate long-term inflammatory sequelae.
