This study investigates the therapeutic impact of inulin—a prebiotic fiber—on metabolic disturbances and ovarian dysfunction in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In both a clinical PCOS cohort and a corresponding mouse model, inulin supplementation significantly reduced hyperandrogenism, improved glucose and lipid metabolism, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed an increased abundance of short‐chain fatty acid–producing taxa (notably co‐abundance group 12, including _Bifidobacterium_ spp.), accompanied by elevated fecal SCFA levels and reduced lipopolysaccharide‐binding protein (LBP), indicating improved gut barrier integrity and lower systemic inflammation. Intraperitoneal LPS administration abolished these benefits, whereas fecal microbiota transplantation from inulin‐treated patients into antibiotic‐depleted mice recapitulated the metabolic and ovarian improvements. These results highlight a key mechanistic role for the gut microbiota in mediating inulin’s beneficial effects and support microbiota modulation as a promising strategy for PCOS management.
